<div class=" access-modal right p-3">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause illnesses such as the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In 2019, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of a disease outbreak that originated in China.</p>
<div id="ad-mobile-top-container">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The virus is now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease it causes is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> outbreak a pandemic.</p>
<p>Public health groups, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr>, are monitoring the pandemic and posting updates on their websites. These groups have also issued recommendations for preventing and treating the illness.</p>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>Signs and symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may appear two to 14 days after exposure. This time after exposure and before having symptoms is called the incubation period. Common signs and symptoms can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Cough</li>
<li>Tiredness</li>
</ul>
<p>Early symptoms of <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> may include a loss of taste or smell.</p>
<p>Other symptoms can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
<li>Muscle aches</li>

<p>The severity of <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> symptoms can range from very mild to severe. Some people may have only a few symptoms, and some people may have no symptoms at all. Some people may experience worsened symptoms, such as worsened shortness of breath and pneumonia, about a week after symptoms start.</p>
<p>People who are older have a higher risk of serious illness from <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>, and the risk increases with age. People who have existing chronic medical conditions also may have a higher risk of serious illness. Certain medical conditions that increase the risk of serious illness from <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serious heart diseases, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy</li>
<li>Cancer</li>
<li>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</li>

<li>Pregnancy</li>
</ul>
<p>Other conditions may increase the risk of serious illness, such as:</p>
<ul>

<h2>Causes</h2>
<p>Infection with the new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (<abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>).</p>
<p>The virus that causes <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> spreads easily among people, and more continues to be discovered over time about how it spreads. Data has shown that it spreads mainly from person to person among those in close contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters). The virus spreads by respiratory droplets released when someone with the virus coughs, sneezes, breathes, sings or talks. These droplets can be inhaled or land in the mouth, nose or eyes of a person nearby.</p>
<p>In some situations, the <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> virus can spread by a person being exposed to small droplets or aerosols that stay in the air for several minutes or hours &mdash; called airborne transmission. It's not yet known how common it is for the virus to spread this way.</p>
<p>It can also spread if a person touches a surface or object with the virus on it and then touches his or her mouth, nose or eyes, although this isn't considered to be a main way it spreads.</p>
<p>Some reinfections of the virus that causes <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> have happened, but these have been uncommon.</p>
<h2>Risk factors</h2>
<p>Risk factors for <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> appear to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Close contact (within 6 feet, or 2 meters) with someone who has <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr></li>
<li>Being coughed or sneezed on by an infected person</li>
</ul>
<h2>Complications</h2>
<p>Although most people with <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> have mild to moderate symptoms, the disease can cause severe medical complications and lead to death in some people. Older adults or people with existing chronic medical conditions are at greater risk of becoming seriously ill with <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>.</p>
<p>Complications can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pneumonia and trouble breathing</li>
<li>Organ failure in several organs</li>
<li>Heart problems</li>
<li>A severe lung condition that causes a low amount of oxygen to go through your bloodstream to your organs (acute respiratory distress syndrome)</li>
<li>Blood clots</li>
<li>Acute kidney injury</li>
<li>Additional viral and bacterial infections</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prevention</h2>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given emergency use authorization for two <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccines, the Pfizer/BioNTech <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccine and the Moderna <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccine. A vaccine might prevent you from getting <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> or prevent you from becoming seriously ill from <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> if you get the <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> virus. You can take additional steps to reduce your risk of infection. <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> and <abbr title="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention">CDC</abbr> recommend following these precautions for avoiding exposure to the virus that causes <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid close contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters) with anyone who is sick or has symptoms.</li>
<li>Keep distance between yourself and others (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters). This is especially important if you have a higher risk of serious illness. Keep in mind some people may have <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> and spread it to others, even if they don't have symptoms or don't know they have <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>.</li>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>
<li>Cover your face with a cloth face mask in public spaces, such as the grocery store, where it's difficult to avoid close contact with others. Surgical masks may be used if available. N95 respirators should be reserved for health care providers.</li>
<li>Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw away the used tissue. Wash your hands right away.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.</li>
<li>Avoid sharing dishes, glasses, towels, bedding and other household items if you're sick.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces, such as doorknobs, light switches, electronics and counters, daily.</li>
<li>Stay home from work, school and public areas if you're sick, unless you're going to get medical care. Avoid public transportation, taxis and ride-sharing if you're sick.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a chronic medical condition and may have a higher risk of serious illness, check with your doctor about other ways to protect yourself.</p>
