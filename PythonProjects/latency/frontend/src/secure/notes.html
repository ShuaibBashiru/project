        Computers with the power of the Internet have succeeded in
         aiding communication among people. The telephone system, 
         which is the main communication system that was invented several 
         years ago, has undergone a great improvement, so much that today we 
         have fixed wireless phones, mobile phones, and the like. With the rapid 
         development of mobile phones come several services, like the Short Messaging Service 
         (SMS) and Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS), which are readily available and add to 
         the usefulness of mobile phones. SMS in particular is widely used in communication and,
          more recently, has been leveraged to provide several services like airline ticketing, 
          banking services, and commercial services such as share and sell where subscribers can 
          asily share and/or sell airtime. SMS is a mobile technology that allows for sending and 
          receiving text or even binary messages to and from a mobile phone. The relative ease of 
          use of SMS makes it possible for a user to learn how to send SMS easily. More than 160
           billion SMSs are exchanged each month in European countries (Mavrakis, 2004), and 
           according to Resource Shelf (2006), 48.7 billion SMS messages were sent in the second 
           half of 2005, which is up 50% from the six months before that. The major advantage of
            SMS is its cost effectiveness and availability, as most individuals own a phone. In 
            different parts of the world, several service providers offer mobile services that
             include SMS. Most times the cost attached to sending a SMS is relatively small, and
              most providers do not charge for receiving SMS. Sometimes, service providers give 
              users a certain amount of free SMS per month, which allows customers send and 
              receive unlimited number of SMS messages. It is possible to acquire a special 
              dedicated line that uses a custom rate for messages sent to the number; it is 
              also possible to have a number as toll free, making it free for users to send SMS 
              to the number. All these contribute to what makes SMS a really cost effective means 
              of disseminating information.
